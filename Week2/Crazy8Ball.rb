# 
# Description: This Ruby script demonstrates how to work with variables. It 
#              generates random numbers to create a fortune-telling game that 
#              provides randomly selected answers to the playerï¿½s questions.
#

# Define custom classes ---------------------------------------------------

#Define a class representing the console window
class Screen

  def cls  #Define a method that clears the display area
    puts ("\n" * 25)  #Scroll the screen 25 times
    puts "\a"  #Make a little noise to get the player's attention
  end
  
  def pause  #Define a method that pauses the display area
    STDIN.gets  #Execute the STDIN class's gets method to pause script
                #execution until the player presses the Enter key
  end
  
end

#Define a class representing the 8-Ball
class Ball

  #Define class properties for the 8-Ball
  attr_accessor :randomNo, :greeting, :question, :goodbye
  
  #Define a method to be used to generate random answers

    #Assign an answer based on the randomly generated number

# Main Script Logic -------------------------------------------------------

Console_Screen = Screen.new  #Initialize a new Screen object
Eight_Ball = Ball.new  #Initialize a new Ball object

Console_Screen.cls  #Clear the display area

Eight_Ball.say_greeting  #Call method responsible for greeting the player

Console_Screen.pause  #Pause the game


answer = ""  #Initialize variable that is used to control the game's first 
             #loop

#Loop until the player enters y or n and do not accept any other input.
until answer == "y" || answer == "n"

  Console_Screen.cls  #Clear the display area

  #Prompt the player for permission to begin the game
  print "Would you like to have your fortune predicted? (y/n)\n\n: "

  answer = STDIN.gets  #Collect the player's response
  answer.chop!  #Remove any extra characters appended to the string

end 

#Analyze the player's response
if answer == "n"  #See if the player elected not to play

  Console_Screen.cls  #Clear the display area

  #Invite the player to return and play again
  Eight_Ball.say_goodbye

    #question
