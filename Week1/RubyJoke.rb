# Define custom classes ---------------------------------------------------

#Define a class representing the console window
class Screen
  def cls  #Define a method that clears the display area
    puts ("\n" * 25)  #Scroll the screen 25 times
  end
end


# Main Script Logic -------------------------------------------------------

Console_Screen = Screen.new  #Initialize a new Screen object

#Execute the Screen object's cls method in order to clear the screen
Console_Screen.cls

#Prompt the player for permission to begin the game
puts "Would you like to hear a few funny jokes? (y/n)"

#Collect the player's response
answer = STDIN.gets

#Remove any extra characters appended to the string
answer.chop!

#Analyze the player's response
if answer == "n"  #See if the player elected not to play

  Console_Screen.cls  #Clear the display area

  #Invite the player to return and play again
  puts "Sorry to hear that. Please return and play again soon."
